## Project Description: 
Our project, Wordle Mania!™, is a unique take on the hit game Wordle, in which players try to guess as many of the randomly generated 5 letter words correctly as possible. In our version, players will have two versions that they can select - a default mode, and a hard mode. In both main versions, players will try to complete as many words as possible in the time allotted. Depending on the mode, players may gain or lose time based on how they play. Players will compete for highscores for their own enjoyment or for a leaderboard where players may input a desired name after a session.
